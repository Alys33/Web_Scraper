    A week after granting an emergency-use authorization for the country’s first COVID-19 vaccine, US regulators have followed with a second: another RNA vaccine, this one made by Moderna of Cambridge, Massachusetts.The emergency-use authorization followed quickly after a panel of external advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously, with one abstention, to recommend use of the vaccine on 17 December. One week earlier, the agency authorized a similar vaccine made by Pfizer of New York City and BioNTech of Mainz, Germany, about a week after UK regulatory authorities did the same.

    US authorization of first COVID vaccine marks new phase in safety monitoring
    The speed of these authorizations reflects the urgency of the pandemic, and is a testament to the scientific advances that made rapid vaccine development possible, said immunologist James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, at the panel meeting on Thursday. “To go from having a sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement.”The authorization is a first for Moderna, a ten-year-old biotechnology company that had long pledged to revolutionize medicine by harnessing RNA as a therapeutic agent, but had yet to push a drug or vaccine all the way through to the clinic. It will join a growing list of organizations with coronavirus vaccines that are being deployed around the world, including teams in China and Russia.In the United States, the vaccines offer a glimmer of hope amid the prospect of a tough winter. The country is logging thousands of deaths from COVID-19 each day, and this is expected to rise over the winter holiday season. Coronavirus infections are so rampant that Moderna was able to reach the primary endpoint of its trial five months earlier than expected, said Jacqueline Miller, senior vice-president and head of infectious diseases at the company.RNA vaccineModerna’s vaccine, which was developed in collaboration with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, works in the same way as the one produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. Both consist of RNA molecules encased in lipid nanoparticles. The RNA in both vaccines encodes a slightly modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 protein known as spike, which enables the virus to infect human cells.Once taken up by cells, the RNA is used to produce the protein, which then triggers an immune response. The RNA does not enter the nucleus where the cell’s genome resides, and is degraded by the cell within a day of the injection.

    COVID vaccine excitement builds as Moderna reports third positive result
    Like Pfizer’s vaccine, Moderna’s seems to be highly effective — about 94% — at preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Its safety profile is also similar to Pfizer’s, with fatigue, headaches and pain at the site of injection among the most often cited side effects.Since the Pfizer vaccine was rolled out in the United Kingdom and the United States, there have been occasional reports of recipients experiencing severe allergic reactions called anaphylaxis after being injected. There have been no signs of such reactions so far in the Moderna trial, which excluded people who have had anaphylactic reactions to previous vaccines, but not those with other allergies, such as reactions to food.The two vaccines differ in the composition of the lipid nanoparticle that encases the RNA, and Moderna’s formulation allows the vaccine to be stored at higher temperature than Pfizer’s, which must be kept at −70 °C, much colder than a normal freezer. Moderna’s vaccine can be stored in a −20 °C freezer for 6 months, and in a refrigerator (at about 4 °C) for 30 days. This promises to streamline the logistics of deploying the vaccine, particularly in rural areas and in countries with limited health-care infrastructure.Continuing trialsFDA advisers spent much of the 17 December committee meeting discussing when and how to offer a vaccine to participants in the placebo arm of Moderna’s trial after an emergency-use authorization is granted. Once a coronavirus vaccine becomes available, participants might choose to leave the trial to guarantee that they can get a jab. Maintaining the integrity of clinical trials after vaccine authorization — to collect data on long-term safety and the duration of protection — is a looming challenge for developers.Last week, Pfizer proposed that when its participants become eligible to receive a vaccine as part of a national roll-out, study investigators will tell them whether they received the vaccine or a placebo. Moderna has instead proposed to ‘unblind’ its whole trial at once after it receives an emergency-use authorization, telling all of its participants which treatment they have received, and offering to vaccinate those in the placebo arm using doses that had already been set aside for the clinical trial.

    Why emergency COVID-19 vaccine approvals pose a dilemma for scientists:
    Some FDA advisers cautioned that this approach would sacrifice valuable weeks of data collection, and allow some participants to receive the vaccine ahead of others in similar priority groups in their communities. Others argued that although the approach is not ideal, it might be necessary given the complexity of the vaccine roll-out in the United States, where individual state and local governments will set their own priorities. “It’s such a hodgepodge here, it’s impractical,” said biostatistician Jeannette Lee at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.Offering trial participants the vaccine could help the company keep them enrolled in the study, so that it can continue to collect data about safety and immunity, said Lindsey Baden, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who was asked by Moderna to speak about the issue to the committee. Some healthcare workers who participated in the trial were already leaving to get the Pfizer vaccine, he said. “If we lose our volunteers the opportunity to learn anything further will be substantially impaired,” he said. “We have to be practical.”

    Michael Regan will be the first Black man to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.Credit: N. C. Department of Environmental Quality


    US president-elect Joe Biden has nominated Michael Regan, North Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to lead the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — and scientists and environmentalists are optimistic.Regan, who will now need to be confirmed by the US Senate, joins other experienced appointees whom Biden has tasked with implementing his historic climate agenda. These include an envoy who will handle international climate negotiations and a coordinator to ensure that goals are achieved at home.

    Can Joe Biden make good on his revolutionary climate agenda?
    “This shows the Biden team is really going to follow through on the bold climate commitments they put forward,” says Leah Stokes, a climate-policy researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It’s a massive political shift, she says, “and it puts the country on track to make climate change the centre of our economic policy”.Regan spent more than nine years working in the EPA’s air-quality programme under former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and another eight years at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group based in New York City. For the past four, he has led the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, where he earned the support of many environmentalists by standing up to chemical and energy companies.“Climate change is the most significant challenge humanity faces. We’ll make meaningful progress together by listening to every voice — from our youth & frontline communities to scientists & our workforce. I will be honored to be part of that work as EPA Administrator,” said Regan on Twitter on 18 December.Rebuilding the EPAIf confirmed, Regan will inherit an agency demoralized by four years under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration sidelined scientists at the agency and disregarded scientific evidence in an unprecedented effort to scale back environmental and public-health protections. Current and former EPA staff recently told Nature about their hopes that Biden can turn things around, although they also highlighted some big challenges he’ll face in doing so.

    Science under siege: behind the scenes at Trump’s troubled environment agency
    Regan has experience with such situations. When he joined North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality in 2017, under newly elected Democratic governor Roy Cooper, staff felt undermined by the previous Republican governor’s industry-friendly policies, says Jeremy Symons, an environmental consultant in Arlington, Virginia, who worked with Regan at the Environmental Defense Fund. Regan was able to rebuild the agency and improve the state’s processes for chemical regulation and disposal of residual coal-ash waste from coal-fired power plants, says Symons.“Michael Regan will be exactly the kind of administrator that the EPA needs to fix the damage that was done under four years of Trump and tackle the climate and health crisis facing Americans,” he adds.The Environmental Protection Network in Washington DC, an organization formed by EPA alumni to speak out against Trump’s undermining of the agency, also endorses Regan’s appointment. Michael Regan “has the background and experience to tackle ongoing threats to people’s health and the environment, profound challenges of #climatechange and systemic environmental injustice”, the group posted on Twitter on 17 December.Environmental justiceRegan is expected to put new emphasis on environmental justice, to protect poor and under-represented communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change. In North Carolina, he created the state's first Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board to address these issues. Biden put emphasis on environmental justice during his campaign for president, promising to invest 40% of his US$2-trillion climate plan in disadvantaged communities.Regan “has the experience, understands the challenges faced by environmental-justice communities, and has demonstrated a commitment to addressing them”, said Peggy Shepard in an e-mail to Nature. Shepard is co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, an advocacy group based in New York.Climate cabinetAt the EPA, one of Regan’s jobs will be to craft regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from vehicles and industry — an effort that is intended to sit at the heart of Biden’s strategy to mitigate climate change. But Biden’s climate agenda is broad: he has committed to ramping up clean energy production, expanding low-carbon infrastructure and reaching zero greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector by 2035. Meeting those goals will require action across the federal government, and Biden is already assembling a team of high-profile climate appointees to advance that effort.

    Can Joe Biden rebuild the ravaged US Environmental Protection Agency?
    On the international front, former secretary of state John Kerry will serve as climate envoy, leading the administration’s effort to reintegrate the country into the Paris climate agreement. Biden has also appointed Gina McCarthy, a staunch environmentalist and former EPA head, as his US climate czar. In this position, McCarthy, who helped implement former president Barack Obama’s climate agenda, will coordinate climate action across all federal agencies. Neither of these team members need to be confirmed by the Senate.These and other appointments signal that Biden is gearing up for action on all fronts, says Symons, who is part of the Climate 21 Project, an independent group of academics, policy specialists and former government officials that has crafted a blueprint for federal climate action. “What we were looking for is a White House structure that could rapidly mobilize the entire government to act on climate change,” he says, and so far, “there’s no question that president-elect Biden is exceeding our expectations.”To read more about Biden's picks for science agency heads and advisers, see Nature’s updated guide.

    Lightning typically forms with the aid of warm air, which is why it has historically been rare in the Arctic.Credit: Tommy Eliassen/Science Photo Library


    Lightning is striking the Arctic many times more often than it did a decade ago, a study suggests — and the rate could soon double. The findings demonstrate yet another way Earth’s climate could be changing as the planet warms, although not all researchers agree that the trend is real.Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle and leader of the study, defends the findings. “We’re seeing a symptom of global climate change,” he says. Holzworth is director of the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), the collection of ground-based sensors that measured the data. He reported the results on 8 December at a virtual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (and published them before peer review as a preprint1).

    The Arctic is burning like never before — and that’s bad news for climate change
    Another lightning-detection network, whose records do not extend as far back as those Holzworth studied, does not find the same increase.Whether or not lightning is increasing in the Arctic could have a significant impact on the region. The past two years have set records for the largest area of land burnt by wildfires — some of them ignited by lightning — and the most carbon dioxide emitted in the Arctic since records began. More lightning would mean even more chances that wildfires will start, which could in turn put even more climate-altering soot and gases into the air.Polar lightningLightning forms when ice crystals inside convecting storm clouds — those filled with roiling air currents fed by warm air — collide and transfer electrical charge. A charge separation builds up until it hits a threshold, and a lightning stroke is released. Some researchers have predicted that global warming will lead to more convective storms and lightning worldwide as air and ocean temperatures rise2. However, some modelling studies suggest the opposite3.Nonetheless, the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, added lightning to its list of ‘essential climate variables’ in 2016, meaning that observations of lightning could help researchers to track the changing global climate.

    The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, so changes in lightning might be most apparent there. August 2019 saw the most northerly stroke ever detected — just 52 kilometres from the North Pole — according to the Finnish company Vaisala, headquartered in Vantaa, which runs a lightning-detection network. And a July 2014 storm over the Canadian Arctic caused more than 15,000 lightning strokes north of the Arctic Circle4.Lightning in the Arctic is normally rare, accounting for around 0.5% of all global strokes detected by the WWLLN.But Holzworth and his colleagues found that the number of annual summertime lightning strokes above a latitude of 65° N rose from around 35,000 in 2010 to nearly 250,000 this year (see ‘Arctic lightning rising’). The scientists studied the months of June, July and August, when nearly all Arctic lightning occurs. They found increasing numbers of lightning strokes across the Arctic, with most of the activity happening around northern Siberia.Verifying a trendTracking trends in lightning can be difficult because detection networks grow more efficient over time, as advanced sensors are added. So Holzworth and his colleagues ran several analyses to confirm that there was more Arctic lightning happening, not just more being detected. “There’s no question about it,” he says.

    Scientists probe lightning hotspot to predict future strikes
    Vaisala’s network has not recorded the same trend. Its data go back only to 2012, rather than to 2010. But “we don’t see an unambiguous trend toward more lightning at more extreme latitudes”, says Ryan Said, a meteorologist and lightning analyst in Vaisala’s office in Louisville, Colorado.In places that see relatively little lightning, such as the Arctic, just a couple of intense thunderstorms can cause a proportionally huge rise in the total number of lightning strokes detected in a given year, Said notes. With so much year-to-year variability, it can be hard to isolate long-term trends.Some researchers in the community say Holzworth’s findings make sense. The work “supports the wider view of a lightning-richer future for the Arctic”, says Sander Veraverbeke, an Earth-systems scientist at the Free University of Amsterdam. In 2017, Veraverbeke and his colleagues reported that lightning was igniting more wildfires, farther north, than in the past in parts of Alaska and Canada5.

    Arctic sea ice hits second-lowest level on record
    One way to verify Holzworth’s work would be to survey Indigenous and other communities living at high latitudes, says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies Arctic wildfire.Another way is to follow up with further lightning-detection studies. Holzworth’s work shows “an interesting correlation” with changes in global temperature, says Antti Mäkelä, a lightning specialist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki. By next year, Mäkelä and his colleagues will have 20 years of data from a lightning-detection system that spans Norway, Sweden, Finland and Estonia6 — and they plan to analyse the data set to see whether there has been an increase in lightning in northern Scandinavia.
